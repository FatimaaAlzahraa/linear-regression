# linear-regression dataset auto_MPG 
The Auto MPG dataset is a popular dataset for regression tasks in machine learning. It contains various attributes of vehicles along with their corresponding fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, or MPG). The dataset is often used to predict the MPG of a vehicle based on its attributes. Here are the columns present in the Auto MPG dataset:

MPG: This column represents the target variable, which is the fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon. This is the value to be predicted in regression tasks.

Cylinders: This column represents the number of cylinders in the engine of the vehicle. It is a discrete variable indicating the power of the engine.

Displacement: This column represents the displacement of the vehicle's engine, which refers to the total volume of all the cylinders in the engine.

Horsepower: This column represents the horsepower rating of the vehicle, which is a measure of the power output of the engine.

Weight: This column represents the weight of the vehicle, typically measured in pounds. It indicates the mass of the vehicle.

Acceleration: This column represents the rate of acceleration of the vehicle, measured in seconds to reach 60 miles per hour (mph) from a standstill.

Model Year: This column represents the manufacturing year of the vehicle. It is usually represented as a two-digit or four-digit number.

Origin: This column represents the origin of the vehicle, encoded as a categorical variable. It typically indicates the country of origin, such as 1 for the United States, 2 for Europe, and 3 for Asia.
